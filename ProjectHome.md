Source code for elements within openElement.

openElement is a WYSIWYG editor that allows users to build websites using ready-made elements (i.e. image galleries, sliders, etc.) that can be arranged and configured visually and ergonomically.

This code is published as an example of how to create new elements to share with the openElement user community.

Users can also use the source to propose changes and improvements to original elements.
